This is the changelog,summarising changes in each version(some minor changes may be ommited).

# 0.9

# 0.9.1

Fixed a memory safety bug in RString::retain and RVec::retain.

# 0.9.0

Rewrote how prefix types work. now they aren't by reference, 
they use static-reference-like types generated for each prefix type
(those types have a `_Ref` suffix by default).

Flattened many module hierarchies in abi_stable,
leaving many of those items only exposed where they used to be reexported.

Now `#[repr(C, packed)]` prefix types are forbidden.

Added a `PrefixRef` pointer type, which is what the `*_Ref` types wrap,
used as the pointer to the prefix of every prefix type.

Now the `#[sabi(kind(Prefix))]` takes two optional arguments, `prefix_ref` and `prefix_fields`,
defaulting to `prefix_ref = "<DerivingType>_Ref"` and `prefix_fields = "<DerivingType>_Fields"`.

Made the root_module_loader function(declared with the `#[export_root_module]` attribute)
be able to return anything that implements the new `IntoRootModuleResult` trait,
including `Result<_, RBoxError_>`.

Declared the `RootModuleError` type and `LibraryError::RootModule` variant
for the errors returned by root module loaders.

Defined the `abi_stable::library::development_utils` module with helper items for use while
developing a dynamic library.

Made `Constructor`, `MovePtr`, `RRef`, `NulStr`, and `StaticRef`  use
`NonNull` instead of a raw pointer, this allows `Option`s wrapping them to be ffi-safe.

Split off `SharedStableAbi` trait from `StableAbi`, now there's `PrefixStableAbi` and `StableAbi`,
both of which only have `GetStaticEquivalent_` in common.

Renamed `WithMetadataFor` to `PrefixMedata`, and added accessors for its fields.

Removed `PrefixTypeTrait::into_with_metadata` method,added `PrefixFields` and `PrefixRef` assoc types.

Added `staticref` macro for declaring `StaticRef` consts,added `StaticRef::leak_value` constructor.

Added `ImmutableRef` marker trait for reference-like types.

Made `LateStaticRef` generic over the pointer it wraps, using the `ImmutableRef` trait.

Renamed `LateStaticRef::<&T>::initialized` to `from_ref`.

Added the `LateStaticRef::<PrefixRef<P>>::from_prefixref` constructor.

Added `PrefixRefTrait` trait for ffi-safe pointers to prefixes.

Added the `PointsToPrefixFields` marker type,
and `PrefixRefTrait::PREFIX_FIELDS` associated constant to construct it,
this type is required for calling `LateStaticRef::from_prefixref`.

Made `RootModule` trait have an additional `PrefixRefTrait` supertrait.

Added the `abi_stable::for_examples` module, with types used in documentation examples.

Added `Send` + `Sync` supertraits to `TypeChecker` and `ExtraChecks`

Defined the `RMut` type to rewrite how `#[sabi_trait]` passes the method receiver.

Added `sabi_as_rref` and `sabi_as_rmut` methods to `RObject` and `DynTrait` to
get `RRef` and `RMut` to the wrapped value.


Made `abi_stable` testable with [`miri`](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri)

Bumped the minimum supported Rust version to 1.41.0.

Updated these public dependencies:
- core_extensions to "0.1.18"
- libloading to "0.6.4"
- parking_lot to "0.11.0"
- lock_api to "0.4.1"
- crossbeam-channel to "0.5.0"
- serde and serde_derive to "1.0.117"

Fixed the lack of `# Unsafe` docs for some unsafe traits.

Made (small) improvements to all of the documentation.

Added docs to the module that `#[sabi_trait]` generates,
and hid methods in `*_MV` types (they were not supposed to be public).

Added generated docs for nonexhaustive enums, unhid the generated items,
and made the generated constructors `#[doc(hidden)}` when the variants are.

Removed parameters of `assert_nonexhaustive`, using `std::any::type_name` internally instead.

Hid `nonexhaustive_enum::GetVTable::VTABLE_REF`

Added support for pinning RBox.

Added std::iter::\*,Future,Hasher,Error,std::io::\*, and std::fmt::Pointer impls for RBox.

Changed `impl_get_type_info` macro to take a `:ty` parameter.

Made the fields in `InlineStorage` types public.

Added associated constants to construct some types in `abi_stable::marker_type`.

Fixed handling of `unsafe trait` in `#[sabi_trait]`,
before this the `unsafe` was removed in the generated code.

Fixed an unsoundness bug where `LateStaticRef<T>` implemented `Send` + `Sync` even if `T` didn't.

Fixed an unsoundness bug where the `RBpxErrpr` returned from checking the layout
of a library could contain references into the unloaded library,
by using a new `RBorError_::to_formatted_error` method to stringify the error.

Changed `RBox::{from_fmt, from_debug, to_formatted_error}` to take references.

Added check to the `declare_root_module_statics` macro to safeguard against passing `Self`.

Fixed(?) the variance of type parameters in `#[sabi_trait]` generated trait object to be covariant.

Fixed `RMutex::get_mut`, which caused a memory leak.

Fixed `RRwLock::get_mut`, which caused a memory leak.

Fixed exporting of `abi_stable::prefix_type::BoolArrayIter`, before this it was not shown in the docs.

Made `MovePtr<T>` implement `Send` and/or `Sync` when `T` does.

Added `RSliceMut::as_mut_ptr` method
    
Removed the `RSliceMut::into_slice_mut` method (it was marked for deprecation)

Implemented Send and Sync for the RString and RVec iterators.

Made `prefix_type::panic_on_missing_field_val` private

Made `TagErrorVariant` private.

# 0.8

### 0.8.3

- Fixed compilation error in the `as_derive_utils` crate (a "private" dependency of `abi_stable_derive`), caused by a single lifetimes error in the nightly and beta channels.

- Removed the unused `skeptic` build dependency of `abi_stable`, since it was unused, and prevented compilation in Rust 1.34.0

### 0.8.2

Breaking Change(caused by soundness fix in rustc):

[This unsoundness bug for all Cell-like std types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/68206) is going to be solved by making UnsafeCell not propagate niches.

In preparation for this change,this library will not propagate niches from T into `*Cell<T>`,
this will cause runtime errors when loading libraries containing either `*Cell` type wrapping a type with non-zero optimizations (including references,and`NonZero*` types),
and compile-time errors when putting `Option<Cell<NonZero>>` in ffi boundaries.

Dynamic libraries built on a previous patch release might have to be built from scratch,
if they contain the previously mentioned types in their API.

### 0.8.0

Added checks when loading dynamic libraries to ensure that Rust doesn't change how it represents 
zero-sized types in the "C" ABI.
This means that in some rare cases,it won't be possible to link dynamic libraries across a 
certain Rust version because it changed how it represents zero-sized types in the "C" abi.

Added `RBoxError::from_debug` for constructing an `RBoxError` from `Debug + !Display` types.

Added impls of `StableAbi` for `PhantomData` of tuples.

Added the `abi_stable::marker_type::NonOwningPhantom` marker type,
which is a more convenient way to have a `PhantomData<extern "C"fn()->PhantomData<T>>` field
PhantomData is returned from the function because of special case support 
for PhantomData of tuples (eg:`PhantomData<(Foo,Bar)>`)
(tuples don't have a stable abi,but because this is a 1-aligned zero sized type,
it doesn't matter).

Fixed potential soundness bug by replacing `PhantomData<extern "C" fn( $types )>` fields
with `NonOwningPhantom<$types>`.

# 0.7

### 0.7.4

Added guidelines for how dynamic libraries can be evolved.

Made version checking for types looser,so that types are c√≥mpatible so long as it's the in the same  `x.*,*` or `0.y.*` version (ignoring `*`).

Added functions to load the AbiHeader of a dynamic library,
and to upgrade it to a LibHeader.

Added `version_compatibility` crates to test that pull-requests to 
abi_stable don't change the layout of types in an incompatible way.

### 0.7.3

This version constifies many functions,with some mentioned as requiring Rust 1.39 to be const.

These are the constified functions:

```text
abi_stable::std_types::{
    RSlice::from_ref,
    RSlice::from_slice, //from Rust 1.39 onwards

    RSliceMut::{as_ptr, into_mut_ptr},

    RStr::from_str, //from Rust 1.39 onwards
    RStr::{as_rslice, is_empty},

    RString::{as_ptr, as_rstr, from_utf8_unchecked, new},

    RVec::{as_ptr, as_rslice, is_empty, new},
}
```

Now `rstr!()` won't require a literal argument from Rust 1.39 onwards,
it can be any `&str`.



### 0.7.2

Bug fix:

This fixes the version number for abi_stable that is stored in dynamic libraries to 
always be the same as `abi_stable`.
Before this fix the version number was 0.6 which means that you'll have to recompile dynamic libraries of previous patch versions(the 0.7.0 and 0.7.1 versions are yanked because of this).

### 0.7.0

- Added `const fn` constructor functions for 
    `#[sabi_trait]` generated trait objects/DynTrait/RObject.

- Added `RRef<'a,T>` type,as a workaround to allow transmuting `&T` to `&()`.

- Added StableAbi attributes:
    `#[sabi(bounds=""]`:for adding multiple bounds to the StableAbi impl.
    `#[sabi(prefix_bounds=""]`:for adding multiple bounds to the PrefixTypeTrait impl.
    `#[sabi(sabi_opaque_fields]`:
        To treat a field as opaque while still requiring it to impl StableAbi.
    `#[sabi(sabi_opaque_fields]`:
        To treat every field as opaque while still requiring them to impl StableAbi.
    `#[sabi(shared_stableabi())]`:
        replaces the default `T:StableAbi` bound with `T:SharedStableAbi`
    `#[sabi(phantom_const_param="<expr>")]` :
        This adds `<expr>` as a virtual const parameter,
        that is checked for equality like every other const parameter.

- Added ConstGeneric,to have proper const-generics support,
    this allows any type that implements `Eq+Debug+StableAbi+'static` to be 
    used as a const-parameter.

- Added macros for constructing RVec/Tuple0-4/RStr/RSlice/NulStr

- Added NulStr,a nul terminated utf8 string slice.

- Rewrote how type layout constants are represented to be significantly smaller.
    Most of the optimizations are described in the 
    `ffdd68fef8d445d7d91972b0d751db80df887ec4` commit
    (there were some tweaks after that commit,but it's mostly correct).

- Now `#[sabi_trait]trait Trait:'static{}` allows the trait object
    to be constructed from a non-'static reference to a `'static` type,
    removing lifetime supertraits from `Trait` in the generated code.
    Now generates a `Trait_Bound` trait with all the supertraits(including lifetimes).

- Renamed `#[sabi(field_bound="")]` to `#[sabi(accessor_bound="")]`,
    because it only adds a bound to the accessor methods of prefix types.

- Merged the `abi_stable_derive_lib` crate into the `abi_stable_derive` crate.

- Changed error reporting in proc macros to report as many errors as possible,
    pointing at what the cause of the error is.

- Added reborrowing support to `#[sabi_trait]` generated trait objects.

- Changed TypeInfo to use `std::any::type_name` 
    to print the type in error messages from 1.38 onwards.

- Renamed DynTrait/RObject unerasure methods for the common case.

- Split TransmuteElement into
    the CanTransmuteElement marker trait and 
    the TransmuteElement extension trait

- Now forbidding type macros,they will be allowed once 
    referenced lifetime can be detected inside macro invocations.

- Added Debug and Display support in RObject.

- Added a way to add extra checks to type layouts at load time with 
    `#[sabi(extra_checks="")]`,passing a type that implements ExtraChecks.
    Replaced uses of `#[sabi(tag="...")]` by DynTrait/RObject/NonExhaustive.

- Made it possible to borrow from self in SerializeProxyType.

# 0.6

### 0.6.3

- Added documentation examples to virtually every type/method in 
    `abi_stable::{external_types,sabi_types,std_types}`

- Added a few methods/associated functions because examples made it 
    obvious that they were necessary.

- Changed RBoxError_ downcast methods to downcast through a 
    `Box<dyn Error+ ... >` if it wraps one.
    
    This involves a tiny breaking change where downcast now requires 
    `std::error::Error` to be implemented by the error being downcasted.
    This breaking change should not be a problem,
    since `RBoxError::{new,from_box,from}` requires that the type implements the `Error` trait,
    meaning that one can only sensibly downcast to types that implement the trait

- Added `ROnce::NEW` associated constant as a workaround for a compiler bug

- Added `abi_stable::inline_storage::alignment::AlignToUsize`

### 0.6.2

- Added the `#[derive(GetStaticEquivalent)]` derive macro.

- Added `#[sabi(impl_InterfaceType())]` helper attribute to `#[derive(StableAbi)]` 
    and `#[derive(GetStaticEquivalent)]`.

- Replaced most uses of `impl_InterfaceType!{}` with the helper attribute.

- Added comments explaining abi_stable concepts in examples.

### 0.6.0

- Implemented nonexhastive enum derivation and NonExhaustive wrapper type,
    with documentation on how to use them,
    and an extra set of example crates in "examples/2_nonexhaustive/\*".

- Rewrote a lot of the code generated by #[sabi_trait]:
    
    - It now generates a `struct Trait_TO` instead of a type alias,
        wrapping the underlying implementation (DynTrait or RObject).
    
    - Transformed the constructors into associated functions of `Trait_TO`,
        adding the `Trait_TO::from_sabi` to wrap the underlying implementation.
    
    - Added impls delegating the supertraits to the underlying implementation.
    
    - Automatically add supertraits of supertraits.
    
    - Fixed support for Iterator/DoubleEndedIterator,
        parsing the supertrait bound to detect the Iterator Item type.
    
    - Replaced Trait_Marker with `Trait_Interface<'a,'b,A,B,AssocTypeA,AssocTypeB >`.

    - Added `erasability:Erasability` parameter to constructor functions,
        to pass `TU_Unerasable` and `TU_Opaque` by value(instead of as a type parameter).


- Added #[StableAbi] attributes:

    - `#[sabi(phantom_field="name:type")]`

    - `#[sabi(phantom_type_param="type")]`

    - `#[sabi(not_stableabi())]`:to accept type parameters that only implement GetStaticEquivalent_

    - `#[sabi(unsafe_change_type="SomeType")]`:to change the type of the field in the type layout constant.


- Added `#[unsafe_no_layout_constant]` attribute to `#[export_root_module]`,
    to have a abi_stable dynamic library without storing the type layout of the root module.

- Changed (de)serialization of DynTrait/nonexhaustive enums to use proxy types,
    an intermediate type that the type is converted from/to in between (de)serializing.

- Removed where clause in DynTrait type definition.
    Removed `'borr` and IteratorItem associated type from InterfaceBound.
    Changed IteratorItemOrDefault to get the Iterator Item type of a particular InterfaceType.

- Allow reborrowed DynTrait to be unerasable in more situations.

- Added std::error::Error support for DynTrait and #[sabi_trait] traits.

- Added ffi-safe equivalent of serde_json::value::RawValue,
    mostly for use as a (de)serialization proxy type.

- Added GetStaticEquivalent_ to get the `'static` equivalent of a type for type checking.

- Fixed runtime type checking soundness bugs:
    
    - where using `#[sabi(unconstrained())]` would cause the type parameter to be ignored 
        when computing the UTypeId for the type.
        Renamed the attribute to #[sabi(unsafe_unconstrained())].

    - where non-StableAbi fields were treated as opaque,
        even though the `#[sabi(unsafe_opaque_field)]` attribute wasn't applied to them.

    - where checking prefix types against the global view
        didn't return an error when nested fields had errors.

- Made LibHeader safely usable by reference,required making changes to make it thread safe
    (it didn't need to be before).

- Removed bounds from unconditional accessors in prefix_structs.

- Improved how type layout errors are `Display`ed,making them significantly more specific,
    where previously it printed the entire type layout(it could overflow the terminal buffer).

- Moved abi_stability::type_layout to root module,with abi_stability::tagging inside.

- Replaced the True/False in InterfaceType associated types with 
    `Implemented<Trait>` and `Unimplemented<Trait>`,to improve compile-time error messages.

- Added `#[sabi_extern_fn]` attribute,to replace many uses of 
    `extern fn foo(){ extern_fn_panic_handling!{} }`

- Removed suffix from RCmpOrdering variants.

- Moved InlineStorage from sabi_types::rsmallbox to its own top-level module.

- Added Spans (the region of code tokens come from) to most generated code,
    to improve error messages from within macro generated code.



# 0.5

- Added MovePtr type and OwnedPointer trait,mostly for `#[sabi_trait]`.

- Implemented `#[sabi_trait]` attribute for generating ffi-safe trait objects 
    from a trait definition.

- Implemented RObject,the default backend type of `#[sabi_trait]`.

- Made generated type layout constants significantly smaller(in the binary),
    by changing representation of fields and functions to structs of arrays(approximately).

- Added unchecked versions of library loading methods in LibHeader.

- Moved example crates to their own numbered subfolders.

- Added `#[sabi_trait]` example crate,which implement a basic plugin system.

- Moved some top-level abi_stable modules 
    (ignored_wrapper,late_static_ref,return_value_equality,version) 
    to sabi_types.


# 0.4

- Added basic module reflection,changing a few details of how layout is represented.

- Created the sabi_extract tool that converts the module structure of an 
    abi_stable dynamic library to json.

- Streamlined how modules are exported,
    removing the need to specify the LOADER_FN in the RootModule trait,
    as well as constructing the module using the `RootModule::load_*` functions.

- Changed how the root module is accessed after it's loaded,
    using the `<RootMod as RootModule>::get_module` function.

- Added fn root_module_statics to declare the statics associated with a RootModule,
    as well as the `declare_root_module_statics` macro to implement it.

- Changed `RootModule::raw_library_ref` to `RootModule::get_raw_library` ,
    returning the already loaded RawLibrary instead of allowing the user 
    to initialize it themselves.

- Changed how all libraries are loaded so that the abi_stable version they 
    use can be checked,mentioning the abi_stable version in the returned error.

- Renamed `Library` to `RawLibrary`.

- Now the RawLibrary is unloaded after layout checking fails,
    leaking it if layout checking passes instead of doing so when it's loaded.

- Added `#[sabi(refl(pub_getter=" function_name "))]` 
    attribute for code generation (using the layout constant for a type),
    to determine how to access private fields(otherwise they're inaccesible).

- Renamed  `export_sabi_module` to `export_root_module`.

- Added RMutex/RRwLock/ROnce,wrapping parking_lot types.

- Added ffi-safe wrappers for crossbeam channels.

- Added support for #[repr(<IntegerType>)],for enums.

- Added checking of enum discriminants(supports all integer types up to u64/i64).

- Renamed LazyStaticRef to LateStaticRef,made if ffi-safe.





# 0.3 

- Dropped support for 1.33 (no requiring 1.34) due to 
    an ICE caused by associated types in associated constants.

- Renamed VirtualWrapper to DynTrait,moving `I:InterfaceType` to second type parameter.

- Added tags,a dynamically typed data structure used 
    when checking the layout of types at runtime.

- DynTrait can now be constructed from non-`'static` types,
    using `DynTrait::from_borrow√¨ng_*`.

- Added conditional accessors to prefix-types,
    allowing those fields to have any type if disabled 
    (so long as they don't change in size/alignment)

- Added these conditional traits to DynTrait:
    - Send
    - Sync.
    - Iterator
    - DoubleEndedIterator
    - std::fmt::Write
    - std::io::{Write,Seek,Read,BufRead}

- Improved documentation of DynTrait,including multiple examples,
    and how to make a pointer compatible with it.

- Improved the std_types error types,
    to be almost the same as the ones in the standard library.

- Added reborrowing to DynTrait,
    going from DynTrait<'a,P<()>,I> to DynTrait<'a,&(),I>/DynTrait<'a,&mut (),I> .

- Added impl_InterfaceType macro to implement InterfaceType,
    emulating default associated types.

- Changed RCow to be closer to its standard library equivalent.

- Added methods/documentation to ROption/RResult.

- Added RHashMap,with an API very close to the standard HashMap.

# 0.2

- Added SharedStableAbi trait to implement prefix-types (vtables and modules).

- Added a "StaticEquivalent:'static" associated type to StableAbi/SharedStableAbi 
    to construct a type-id from any type,for checking their layout only once

- Added impl_InterfaceType macro for 
    implementing InterfaceType with default associated types.

- Tightened safety around phantom type parameters,
    requiring every type to appear in the layout constant of the type.

- Implemented prefix-types,for extensible vtables/modules,
    along with rewriting existing VTables and modules to use them.

- Implemented private multi-key map for layout checking
    (it's not public purely for documentation reasons).

- Moved example crates to example folder

- Replaced LibraryTrait/ModuleTrait with RootModule trait,
    only allowing the root module to be exported.

- Improved example 0,adding a readme,
    and an example of serializing/deserializing json commands.

- Added documentation for interactions the library has with unsafe code/
    how to write unsafe code that uses the library.

- Many small changes to documentation.
